# Python Programming Task - Blackjack

Authored by: Ashley Wilson

## Running the game

This project has been built using Python 3.6 and there are no dependencies required to run the game (there are some dev dependencies used while writing to project).

Start the game with:

```shell
$ python play.py
```

There are tests for this project runnable with:

```shell
$ ./runtests.py
```

## Future considerations

Given more time I would like to have been able to implement:

 - Doubling
 - Splitting
 - Surrender
 - Betting

Most variants of Blackjack involve using multiple decks of cards, and I hope that with the way I structured the different classes of the game that would be a trivial addition later.

A final note for refactoring would have been the `play.py` file, which grew a little too much as I reached the end of the project!
